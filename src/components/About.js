                        <p class="card-text text-white">I am Quin Bryant. I'm 26 years old and finally figuring out what I want to be when I grow up! 
                               As a child, I was drawn to music and learned to read treble clef and play the flute.
                                It's my first love! Singing is also a passion of mine and I've dabbled in making music and covering songs. 
                               I've sang at weddings and other events as well. 
                               As a millenial, technology was introduced to me slowly and all at once. It has always been a part of my
                                life and an interest of mine so it just made sense for me to begin a career in Web Development. 
                                   I found it comforting and ironic hearing the word 'typography' being used in class as it's just an
                                    example of some of the random things I've found myself intrigued by before embarking on this journey. 
                               I am feeling extremely optimistic and grateful because I can now envision a tangible and successful future in the world of technology.
